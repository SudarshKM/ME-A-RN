- modern programming paradigm which is consider real time entity into object & class

- class :blue print which contains common features from which different object can be create.

- object : are the real time entities that are created from the class.

- reference : the memory location where the properties and methodes are stored.

    property : variable inside a class.
    methode  : functions inside a class.

    syntax
    -------

    class Classname {

      //  property

      //  methodes

      //  constructor () {}   //used to initial values to property
                              //also a methode
                              //class itself-no need to call contructor(), invokes automatically
    }
  

    its not mandatory that all the three , that is property , methodes & constructor should always present inside a class

    - instance variable (this.variableName) 
                in order to access properties inside a class


    object
    -------
    const objectName = new Classname()

    objects are used inorder to acess properties or methodes out-side the class
